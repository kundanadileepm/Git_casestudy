Problem Statement:
You work as a Devops Architect in Zendriix Softwares. The company has been struggling to 
manage their product releases. The releases should happen on 25th of every month. Suggest a 
Git Workflow Architecture for this requirement. 
Simulate this workflow, by creating a pseudo code files and branches, and upload the same to 
your GitHub Account. 

We can implement a Git Workflow Architecture using a branching strategy and automation. Here's a suggested Git Workflow Architecture:
1. Main Branch (main): This branch is the primary development branch and serves as the source of truth. It should always reflect the latest stable state of the application. No direct commits or changes should be made to this branch.
2. Feature Branches (feature/feature-name): For each new feature or development task, create a dedicated feature branch from the main branch. These branches should be used by developers to work on their respective features or bug fixes.
3. Monthly Release Branches (release/month-year): At the start of each month, create a release branch from the main branch. The branch name should reflect the month and year of the release (e.g., "release/11-2023" for November 2023). This branch serves as the stabilization branch for the upcoming release.
4. Bug Fix Branches (bugfix/issue-number): If issues or bugs are identified in the release branch, create bug fix branches from the release branch. These branches should be used to fix critical issues that must be addressed before the release.
5. Hotfix Branches (hotfix/issue-number): In case of critical hotfixes that need immediate attention and cannot wait for the next monthly release, create hotfix branches from the main branch. Hotfixes should be merged into both the main branch and the current release branch.
6. Development Workflow:
   - Developers work on their respective feature branches.
   - Regularly merge changes from the main branch into feature branches to keep them up to date.
   - When a feature is ready, create a pull request from the feature branch to the main branch for code review.
   - Once a feature is approved, merge it into the main branch.
   - At the beginning of each month, create a new release branch.
   - Bug fixes for the upcoming release are made in bug fix branches.
   - Hotfixes are made in hotfix branches.
7. Release Workflow:
   - Test and stabilize the code in the release branch throughout the month.
   - Merge bug fixes into the release branch as needed.
   - Perform final testing and quality assurance on the release branch.
   - On the 25th of the month, create a release tag from the release branch, and this tag represents the stable release.
